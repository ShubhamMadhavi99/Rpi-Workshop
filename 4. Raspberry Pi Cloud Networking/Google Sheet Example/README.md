In this example, Arduino reads sensor data connected to A0 pin and sends it to Raspberry Pi / PC through USB. On receiving this data, Raspberry Pi/PC sends the data to Google Sheet.

# Codes
- Upload Arduino_code.ino to Arduino/ESP8266/Any ArduinoIDE-based board
- Upload RPi_Python_code.py to Raspberry Pi or Laptop/PC and run it on Python
- Upload Google_Sheet_code.gs to Google Sheet's App Script. Please Refer to Google Sheet Manual in this folder for detailed steps on how to setup Google sheet for this example.
