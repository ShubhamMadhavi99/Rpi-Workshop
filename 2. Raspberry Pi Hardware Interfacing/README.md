## LED Interfacing
In this interfacing , Raspberry pi GPIO pin, i.e., pin 8 ( GPIO 14 ) is connected to LED and ground is applied through pin 6. Use 3.3V supply for LED connection. Ensure that you have connected a resistor of min 1K resistor between the LED and Ground. If it is not connected, then the circuit may work, but extra power may be drawn from Pi Board resulting in crash of board or SD-Card.

## SERVO MOTOR
Servo Motor is having 3 pins, BROWN - Ground, Orange - Input, RED - 5V Supply. All these pins are to be coonectd to RPi Board. Here, while perfroming this experiment dont leave the circuit on for a long period. If possible perfrom serial interface and use arduino to control the servo motor.
