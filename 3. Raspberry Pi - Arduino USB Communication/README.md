There are two examples in this folder:

1. Simple Message Exchange 
2. Gas Sensor Example

# Simple Message Example

On connecting Arduino to USB port, Raspberry Pi / PC asks for "Password?" through USB port. 

The Arduino then responds with "Hello" which is the password.

The Arduino is accepted as a valid device

Arduino sends message "Hello from Arduino" every 5 seconds.

# Gas sensor Example

On connecting Arduino to USB port, Raspberry Pi / PC asks for "Password?" through USB port. 

The Arduino then responds with "Hello" which is the password.

The Arduino is accepted as a valid device

Arduino senses Gas Sensor / Any Analog Sensor on pin A0 every 5 seconds

Arduino prints this data to USB port after sensing

Raspberry Pi / PC receives this data and prints on console.
